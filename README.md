My Twilio iOS Voice Client files.

## Files

ViewController.swift : my updated version which has functions orginized by calling and receiving a call.
I also added additional log statements.

My version is from: https://github.com/twilio/voice-quickstart-swift

accessToken.js : Twilio Function to generate access tokens. This is the same for Twilio Voice Android and iOS Clients.

makecall.js : Twilio Function to provide TwiML to make calls. This is the same for all client versions: Twilio Voice Android and iOS Clients, and Twilio JavaScript Web Client.

Note, I have yet to include setup instructions.
